    "content":"<p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>Grammy-winning artist Harry Styles announced on social media Wednesday (March 23, TODAY!) that his highly anticipated third studio album, Harry’s House, will arrive May 20th.</p> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>According to the press release, Harry’s House will have 13 tracks — more than any of his previous albums. Though no further details on the album’s tracklist are available yet, the 'Watermelon Sugar' singer did unveil the Harry’s House cover art: a photo of a confused-looking Harry scratching his face as he stands on the ceiling of an upside-down living room.</p> <h4 style='font-weight:600; padding:30px 0'>Trailer Teaser and Dedicated Page</h4> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>Styles also released a 40-second trailer for the new album, wherein he walks pensively onto a theater stage and smiles into the camera as the outline of a yellow house rises above him.</p> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>The 28-year-old pop star’s announcement confirms the theories of some of his detective-eyed fans, who noticed he’d followed social media accounts titled You Are Home. They also discovered a mysterious website YouAreHome.co, which shows nothing but a beige door that updates every day to open up and show a different image when you hover over it (doesn’t work well on mobile).</p> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>As of the album announcement, the door has changed to the Harry’s House cover art.</p> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>Harry’s House follows 2019’s Fine Line — for which he just finished up his world tour — and his 2017 self-titled debut album</p> <h4 style='font-weight:600; padding:30px 0'>My Thoughts...</h4> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>I was in class when my friend sent me the instagram post Harry announced the release of his new album. Although, I had been anticipating that he was going to release something soon, like a music video, because of what the Harry accounts that I follow were posting about some speculations and he had been filming a music video in London, but I was not waiting for that new release to be a whole album! The cover of the album is just soooo pretty, it’s the best one so far, but I don’t know how I feel about the name of the album… it’s the second album where he has included his name in an album and it just makes him look like he’s full of himself…</p> <p>As we wait for the new release, here are some fan reaction’s to the announcements:</p>"

The other great cover he did was “The Chain” by Fleetwood Mac, which many people started headbanging to. The audience was so engaged that it made the whole experience 100 times better.

At the end of the show, I wanted to get some memorabilia, but all his merchandise was overpriced, and it just wasn’t worth it, so I found some metal nut that resembled a ring, and I just kept that as my memorabilia, and I wore it for like 2 years until I lost it which was a sad day.

The odd arrangement inspired the short-lived CBS comedy series “Happy Together” starring Damon Wayans Jr. and Amber Stevens West. Felix Mallard played the character inspired by Harry.</li> <Image src='/funfact6.png' width='50%' height='50%' alt=''/> </ol>"

    "snippet":"Some sacrifices will be made… but a positive twist is I’ll share my fav song from each album",
    "content":"<p style='padding-bottom:30px'>I’d say I’ve listened to about 85% of the songs One Direction had released just because I judged the first 15 seconds of the song, and if I didn’t like it, I would skip to the chorus, and if I still didn’t like it, I completely ignored that song. So, I can’t say I can adequately rank the albums, but I’m still gonna do it (idc). I’m ranking these from least favourite to best. I’m also going to be picking my favourite (no singles) song of each album (but most likely, I had 1-4 favourites, so I’m going to have to make some sacrifices). Let’s get this party started!</p> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between'> <Image src='/UpAllNight.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40%'/> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#5 – Up All Night</h4> <p>Given that this was their first album, all the songs sound the same to me. I got tired of WMYB to the point where I’m just annoyed that anytime One Direction is mentioned, people automatically start singing that song</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: Gotta Be You</p> </div> </div> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between; padding:70px 0'> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#4 – Take Me Home</h4> <p>There’s not much to say other than I find myself singing some of the catchy songs from this album like “Kiss You” and “I Would” and the overall mix of songs were better than the last one.</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: C’mon C’mon (Harry’s vocals in this 🤯)</p> </div> <Image src='/TakeMeHome.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40% height:fit-content'/> </div> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between'> <Image src='/MidnightMemories.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40% height:fit-content'/> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#3 – Midnight Memories</h4> <p>Here is where I believe their music really took off. Harry actually wrote his first song here, “Happily”, a pretty good bop. For sure, I have many favourites in this album that are just super upbeat. I live for Zayn’s high notes on “You and I” and “Right Now”. Love, love, and love it!</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: Through the Dark</p> </div> </div> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between; padding:70px 0'> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#2 – Made in the A.M</h4> <p>The overall sound of the album sounded very mature, and not sure if the maturer-me just prefers it because of that, or else I would think Midnight Memories is #2. It ranges from sad songs like “I Want to Write You a Song”, “Infinity” or “If I Could Fly” that are just calming, or when I’m in a dancing/grooving mood, “Olivia” or “What a Feeling” are great. The only bad thing is, DJ Malik had “zayned” 😥</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: What A Feeling</p> </div> <Image src='/MadeInTheAM.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40% height:fit-content'/> </div> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between'> <Image src='/Four.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40% height:fit-content'/> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#1 – Four</h4> <p>This album for sure had more bops that I think possibly anyone who listens to it can leave with one song being stuck in their head. Beautiful harmonies are heard in “Once in a Lifetime” and “Illusion” which I adore. There are only 2 songs I don’t like, so that about sums up how this ended up being my favourite album. Best songs to dance/groove to are “Act my Age”, “Girl Almighty”, and “No Control”. And here is where Niall sung, “we took a chonce”.</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: Fireproof❤️‍🔥</p> </div> </div>"

    "content":"<p style='padding-bottom:30px'>After One Direction came in 3rd in the X-Factor, Simon Cowell was willing enough to sponsor them to continue their careers as singers. They released their debut track “What Makes You Beautiful” (that has now reached over 1 Billion views) and it premiered at No.28 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles. After this, they went on to create their first debut album “Up All Night” and they became household names in the U.K, U.S, and beyond. The popular song became so impactful that they found themselves on the biggest of international stages when they performed “What Makes You Beautiful” at the closing ceremony o the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. They then released “Take Me Home”, “Midnight Memories”, “Four”, and “Made in the A.M”. After 5 years together, the band announced their “hiatus”(it’s been 7 years!!) and each one pursued their solo careers.</p><p>In 2016, Harry signed a solo contract with Columbia Records and released his self-titled debut album 11 months later to critical acclaim, and later embarked on a world tour (I was lucky enough to attend). Through this time however of his first release of his set-titled album, he was relatively not as big as Justin Bieber or Shawn Mendes, but only after his sophomore album, “Fine Line” came out in late 2019, his hit singles hit a different chord in the world.
