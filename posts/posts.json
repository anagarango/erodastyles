    "content":"<p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>Grammy-winning artist Harry Styles announced on social media Wednesday (March 23, TODAY!) that his highly anticipated third studio album, Harry’s House, will arrive May 20th.</p> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>According to the press release, Harry’s House will have 13 tracks — more than any of his previous albums. Though no further details on the album’s tracklist are available yet, the 'Watermelon Sugar' singer did unveil the Harry’s House cover art: a photo of a confused-looking Harry scratching his face as he stands on the ceiling of an upside-down living room.</p> <h4 style='font-weight:600; padding:30px 0'>Trailer Teaser and Dedicated Page</h4> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>Styles also released a 40-second trailer for the new album, wherein he walks pensively onto a theater stage and smiles into the camera as the outline of a yellow house rises above him.</p> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>The 28-year-old pop star’s announcement confirms the theories of some of his detective-eyed fans, who noticed he’d followed social media accounts titled You Are Home. They also discovered a mysterious website YouAreHome.co, which shows nothing but a beige door that updates every day to open up and show a different image when you hover over it (doesn’t work well on mobile).</p> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>As of the album announcement, the door has changed to the Harry’s House cover art.</p> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>Harry’s House follows 2019’s Fine Line — for which he just finished up his world tour — and his 2017 self-titled debut album</p> <h4 style='font-weight:600; padding:30px 0'>My Thoughts...</h4> <p style='padding-bottom:30px 0'>I was in class when my friend sent me the instagram post Harry announced the release of his new album. Although, I had been anticipating that he was going to release something soon, like a music video, because of what the Harry accounts that I follow were posting about some speculations and he had been filming a music video in London, but I was not waiting for that new release to be a whole album! The cover of the album is just soooo pretty, it’s the best one so far, but I don’t know how I feel about the name of the album… it’s the second album where he has included his name in an album and it just makes him look like he’s full of himself…</p> <p>As we wait for the new release, here are some fan reaction’s to the announcements:</p>"

    "snippet":"There’s bound to be some disagreement to this list, but they’re ranked based on how I’m feeling when I wrote this post",
    "content":"<p>This is going to be a toughie, I genuinely enjoy (almost) every song, but I need to be in the right state of mind to consider it as one of my favourite songs, so the way I’m ranking these right now is based on how I feel about them most of the time. There’s bound to be some disagreement to this list, but hey, you can blame the environment for manipulating my emotions in feeling this way for each song. I would rank all of them into one list, but it’s hard to do so since both albums are very different from each other, in my opinion, and they’re both great in their own way. In the end, I’ll be sharing my thoughts on which album I prefer more. Let’s get started… <h4 class='subheading'>Harry Styles (Self-titled album)</h4> <div> <p class='olnum'>10. Ever Since New York – it’s a bit repetitive, just not that memorable compared to his other songs (and I find it quite boring). </p> <p class='olnum'>9. Meet Me in the Hallway – I like the sad tone, but I do skip it most of the time. Just something is missing but not too sure what it is.</p> <p class='olnum'>8. From the Dining Table – this song puts me to sleep in a good way. He’s literally whispering in your ear, and it just gives me goosebumps. It’s so calming and intimate, and there’s one point when he harmonizes, but I see this more as a sweet voice message than a song (which isn’t bad, but that’s why I’m not putting this higher on my list, sadly.</p> <p class='olnum'>7. Two Ghosts – I’d say this is similar to “Sweet Creature” but just misses the mark. It is a very chill song that fits in with most of the album. Overall this song is really good and still one I love listening to.</p> <p class='olnum'>6. Sign of the Times – Don’t get me wrong, it feels wrong to rank it this low, although I did love this song when it came out, and I even learned how to play it on the piano cause I liked it so much, but it has been overplayed so many times. It was a pleasant surprise, and this was where it all started. It’s a fantastic song. It’s just that the radio made it annoying-ish.</p> <p class='olnum'>5. Carolina – This one is very lyric-heavy and has a rock vibe to it, and it’s just a good song to sing along to. An upbeat song with a fun beat that isn’t crazy. Nonetheless, a great song to groove to, and I would recommend that people who don’t know Harry listen to this one.</p> <p class='olnum'>4. Sweet Creature – such sweet melody and message. My heart just melts, thinking who inspired him to write such a beautiful song. I learned how to play it on ukulele, and this could ultimately be a great campfire song to play and listen to. Love love love it</p> <p class='olnum'>3. Woman – I probably like this song way more than the right amount of love it deserves, but the bass guitar just melts me. The slow tempo just hits right with the lyrics, and it’s a great song to groove. There are not many complaints other than it repeats a bit, but the instruments excuse it.</p> <p class='olnum'>2. Kiwi – This song made my jaw drop the first time I heard it. This one took me by surprise as I never imagined him creating such a rock song. I love it, and it’s a great song to yell the lyrics and dance, especially in concert. The only complaint I have is that it’s hard to find a good place to actually enjoy the song the way it’s supposed to be enjoyed since this song is meant to be blasted, and that would require patient neighbours and/or roommates maybe being home alone.</p> <p class='olnum'>Only Angel – the first minute always gives me goosebumps, it sounds so angelic like you’re on your way to heaven, and when the beat just hits, it blasts you back to earth with a rock to it. There’s not much to say other than the song takes you on a ride. I will thank him forever for choosing this song to be his opening in his first tour, it just fitted perfectly, and I couldn’t imagine a better song to start with.</p> </div> <h4 class='subheading'>Fine Line</h4> <div> <p class='olnum'>12. Watermelon Sugar – The radio ruined this song for me (super overplayed). Any store I was in would always be playing, and it annoyed me seeing that when people think of Harry, they think of this song. Anyone who tells me their favourite song is this, I don’t trust him, and if they say they’re Harry fans, they’re liars! I would honestly write a short essay about this argument. It pains me when I tell people my favourite artist is Harry, and they either start singing Watermelon Sugar or say something about how great that song is, I just cringe. However, this song gave him a Grammy, so I’m happy for him, and that other people find enjoyment in it.</p> <p class='olnum'>11. To Be So Lonely – I usually just skip this song whenever it comes up. It’s just missing something that I can’t put my finger on. </p> <p class='olnum'>10. Golden – many people find this song their favourite. I love the lyrics, but something about the beat and sound of it just doesn’t sit right with me. I love the music video, and it did elevate the music a bit. It’s a cute song, and I don’t have much to justify it to rank it this low, but I just don’t like it as much as others.</p> <p class='olnum'>9. Adore You – I do enjoy this song a lot. I’m surprised it didn’t win as much praise as Watermelon Sugar which this one was also overplayed. It’s so upbeat, and whenever I listen to it, it puts me in a different mood.</p> <p class='olnum'>8. Cherry – this song just makes me jealous of Harry’s ex, Camille Rowe, which is heavily implied that he is singing about his relationship with her. Sounds so bittersweet, and what makes it worse is that he used a voice message from her at the end…. aghhhhhh!!!</p> <p class='olnum'>7. Lights Up – This one divided audiences when it first dropped because it just sounded so different from his last album. The music video… I mean, if you are a Harry fan, you would be lying if you said you didn’t watch it more than twice.</p> <p class='olnum'>6. Falling – I’d say it’s the most emotional song because the lyrics have so much meaning and depth. I would slightly rank it lower, but the video moved it up. I definitely recommend this song to anyone who just wants to find an excuse to cry.</p> <p class='olnum'>5. Fine Line – Lyrically and musically beautiful. I listen to this song anytime I’m sad, and it is just such an inspirational song to listen to. The instrumental part is just so delicious. </p> <p class='olnum'>4. Treat People with Kindness – when I first heard this song, I just knew it would be a fun song to sing and dance to in a concert. Definitely a great song to blast and for anyone who just wants to jump. </p> <p class='olnum'>3. Canyon Moon – It has a really fun and quirky sound to it. Instrumentally, it sounds great and harry’s harmonizing sounds amazing too. Stevie Nicks even said this one is her favourite, and I don’t blame her.</p> <p class='olnum'>2. She – The electric guitar. Enough said. Mitch (Harry’s close friend and guitarist) just makes love with that guitar. This song is amazing instrumentally, the chorus just hits so hard and sounds so seductive and relaxing. It’s similar to “Woman,” and the lyrics tell a story.</p> <p class='olnum'>1. Sunflower, Vol. 6 – a fun and upbeat song. It’s such a summer song, but its bridge makes it feel like a Christmas song. This song just puts me in the right mood. The beat is really good, and the lyrics are fun, making this song one of the best from the album.</p> </div> <hr style='margin:20px 0'/> <h4 class='subheading'>Which Album Do I Prefer?</h4> <p style='padding:0 0 10px 0'>I do like both albums. They’re both special in their own way. But because where I was in a different place when I heard it, his first self-titled album feels like home to me. It makes me very nostalgic, and it just feels so personal that it puts me in a different place and reality anytime I heart through all of it. I was kind of anxious since around that time, I was worried in school because teachers had already been pressuring us to start planning what I wanted to do in life for work (in Grade 10?!?!), and it bothered me that I didn’t really have an answer, so I was kind of bummed out, and it was around that time Harry’s first album came out, and it just helped me so much. So that album holds a special place in my heart.</p> <p>If I want to convince someone to give Harry a chance, I would recommend Fine Line since it has many songs that people enjoy. I still enjoy that album, and it definitely has some great songs that I definitely recommend non-Harry fans to check out and they might get hooked.</p>"

    "content":"<p>White-blond, blue-eyed Harry arrived in the world in 1994. Gemma, his sister, shares 'He was very loud, I think the first time I got in serious trouble was when I pushed him off a chair because he just wouldn’t stop crying.” She remembers Harry once joining the family dog in his basket, shoving his pacifier in the pup’s mouth. For Harry, the earliest memory he has was when his family took a trip to Walt Disney World when he was five and 'everything seemed so big and fun and I loved it” as quotes on the book Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction.</p> <h4 class='subheading'>School Days</h4> <p style='padding:0 0 10px 0'>In preschool, 'I was pretty well behaved and I didn’t get in a lot of trouble or anything. I was more interested din playing than being naughty.' His transition to primary school went smoothly too as he says '… I had a few friends there so I settled in quickly and never minded being there.” He enjoyed drawing attention to himself and would do small acts so people could look at him and would often like to be the main head of a play. Here is a video of him in a small play: Not long after, he became more experimental. 'I got a bit cheekier as time went on, and when I was about 8 or 9, i started testing the boundaries'. He would push his luck on his teachers and was getting 'much more interested in girls'. He had his first 'actual' girlfriend at age 12 and his first serious relationship when he was 15, he mentioned that he 'worshipped the ground she walked on'. In secondary school, Gemma shares that he was 'a joker, talkative and very distracting — not ideal for a productive lesson. Often they wouldn’t instantly realize we were related.' Although Gemma she wrote that she 'would have traded my A’s for his B’s and charisma in a heartbeat.' Alternatively, Harry envied his sister’s brains. Harry shares, 'she always outsmarted me, and I was always jealous of that.'</p><div class='div-images'> <img src='/baby1.jpg'/><img src='/baby2.jpg'/><img src='/baby3.jpg'/></div> <p>At age 13 or 14, Harry had joined a friend’s band, White Eskimo, and picked up a part-time job at a local bakery, W. Mandeville Bakery. His former boss from the bakery shared 'he was the most polite member of staff we’ve had. He was really a hard worker, he served, cleaned, scrubbed, and washed.” The bakery has even placed a poster of a picture of Harry working there. 'Customers really took a shine to him.' His father, Desmond, was in awe of his son’s social skills. 'From singing in the car or on holiday, he’d always be able to hold a crowd even when he was a kid.' His mother, Anne, says 'he’s always loved attention and making people laugh. he’s certainly not shy about himself.'</p><div class='div-images'> <img src='/teenager1.jpg'/><img src='/teenager2.jpg'/><img src='/teenager3.jpg'/></div> <h4 class='subheading'>Family Values</h4> <p style='padding:0 0 10px 0'>When his parents divorced, Desmond remembers that 'both the children were crying” when Harry was 7 years old and 3 years later, his father moved out, and Harry and Gemma stayed with Anne. All of Harry’s manners came from Anne, she brought him and his sister, both becoming polite and well-mannered. Anne never let fame take up Harry’s ego and would keep him grounded. Harry shares 'he grew up with my mum and sister… You have this idea of what being masculine is and as you grow up and experience more of the world, you become more comfortable with who you are.'</p> <p>While he was still developing and finding himself a place in the world, he had auditioned for X-Factor at 16, and his life just got crazier from there.</p>"

But finally, on the day of the concert, I was putting together my outfit, and I practically had like 4 hours of sleep because I was so excited to see him perform live. Like every kilometre I got closer to the arena (Rogers Arena), I remember that my heart would beat faster and like I was getting nervous cause I had high expectations. I didn’t encounter any problems from my home to the seats we purchased, so it much pretty much perfect, and I had no stress. Kacey Musgraves opened for him; although I didn’t know much about her, I still enjoyed it, and I believe she was singing her songs from her album Golden Hour which won like 4 Grammys. After she left the stage, songs were playing background like One Direction “Olivia” and The Beatles’ “Hey Jude”, and everyone was just singing and dancing to it or waiting around as they set the stage for Harry to enter.</p> <Image src='/vancouver0.png' width='50%' height='100%' alt=''/> <h3 style='font-size:18px; font-weight:600; padding-top:50px'>Harry Enters</h3> <p style='padding:20px 0'>Finally, after like 30 minutes, they dimmed the lights, and everyone just started screaming. At this point, I would say my heart rate was at a solid 120. As soon as the angelic intro of “Only Angel” started playing, the monitor blocking the stage began to lift to the ceiling with stage lights shining towards the audience, and you can just see Harry’s silhouette standing before he starts singing. When I saw his silhouette, my knees were about to melt, like they started shaking like crazy, and it didn’t help that everyone was like crying and/or wooing, and I was holding my phone filming all of it, so the camera was shaky. As soon as he started singing, my brain was just so overwhelmed by how good his voice sounded on the speakers, like it sounded amazing. I could feel the music’s bass shake the floor and feel it through my body (I would place a video playing one of songs, but WordPress only allows 2 Mb files, like WHY??).</p> <h3 style='font-size:18px; font-weight:600; padding-top:50px'>Rest of the Concert</h3> <p style='padding:20px 0'>After he finished the first song, my knees got better, and I enjoyed every song after that. At one point, he oAfter he finished the first song, my knees got better, and I enjoyed every song after that. At one point, he only plays his guitar with no other music and starts singing and playing “If I Could Fly” by One Direction, which touched my soul. He made it sound so sad, and then he sang “Just A Little Bit of Your Heart” by Ariana Grande, which he had written and passed it to her, which sounded terrific and probably preferred the way he sang it. The other great cover he did was “The Chain” by Fleetwood Mac, which many people started headbanging to. The audience was so engaged that it made the whole experience 100 times better. When “Sign of the Times” was starting, everyone prior had passed on little red stickers that are somewhat see-through, so placed it on top of their phone’s flashlight so when he began singing, everyone’s flashlight shined red, and others white that looked so pretty, and the drums beat sounded so good. At the end of the show, I wanted to get some memorabilia, but all his merchandise was overpriced, and it just wasn’t worth it, so I found some metal nut that resembled a ring, and I just kept that as my memorabilia, and I wore it for like 2 years until I lost it which was a sad day. The next day after the concert, my throat was sore from the screaming and wooing, but I’ll never forget that day.</p> <div style='display:flex; gap:5px'> <Image src='/vancouver1.png' width='50%' height='100%' alt=''/> <Image src='/vancouver2.png' width='50%' height='100%' alt=''/> </div>"

Harry has become an avid reader. “Reading didn’t really use to be my thing. I had such a short attention span,” he said. “But I was dating someone who gave me some books; I felt like I had to read them because she’d think I was a dummy if I didn’t read them.” Styles added that Haruki Murakami’s “Norwegian Wood” was the first book he couldn’t put down and sparked his interest in the hobby.</li> <li style='padding:15px 0 15px 40px'>11.

    "snippet":"Some sacrifices will be made… but a positive twist is I’ll share my fav song from each album",
    "content":"<p style='padding-bottom:30px'>I’d say I’ve listened to about 85% of the songs One Direction had released just because I judged the first 15 seconds of the song, and if I didn’t like it, I would skip to the chorus, and if I still didn’t like it, I completely ignored that song. So, I can’t say I can adequately rank the albums, but I’m still gonna do it (idc). I’m ranking these from least favourite to best. I’m also going to be picking my favourite (no singles) song of each album (but most likely, I had 1-4 favourites, so I’m going to have to make some sacrifices). Let’s get this party started!</p> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between'> <Image src='/UpAllNight.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40%'/> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#5 – Up All Night</h4> <p>Given that this was their first album, all the songs sound the same to me. I got tired of WMYB to the point where I’m just annoyed that anytime One Direction is mentioned, people automatically start singing that song</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: Gotta Be You</p> </div> </div> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between; padding:70px 0'> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#4 – Take Me Home</h4> <p>There’s not much to say other than I find myself singing some of the catchy songs from this album like “Kiss You” and “I Would” and the overall mix of songs were better than the last one.</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: C’mon C’mon (Harry’s vocals in this 🤯)</p> </div> <Image src='/TakeMeHome.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40% height:fit-content'/> </div> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between'> <Image src='/MidnightMemories.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40% height:fit-content'/> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#3 – Midnight Memories</h4> <p>Here is where I believe their music really took off. Harry actually wrote his first song here, “Happily”, a pretty good bop. For sure, I have many favourites in this album that are just super upbeat. I live for Zayn’s high notes on “You and I” and “Right Now”. Love, love, and love it!</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: Through the Dark</p> </div> </div> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between; padding:70px 0'> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#2 – Made in the A.M</h4> <p>The overall sound of the album sounded very mature, and not sure if the maturer-me just prefers it because of that, or else I would think Midnight Memories is #2. It ranges from sad songs like “I Want to Write You a Song”, “Infinity” or “If I Could Fly” that are just calming, or when I’m in a dancing/grooving mood, “Olivia” or “What a Feeling” are great. The only bad thing is, DJ Malik had “zayned” 😥</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: What A Feeling</p> </div> <Image src='/MadeInTheAM.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40% height:fit-content'/> </div> <div style='display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:space-between'> <Image src='/Four.png' width={150} height={150} style='width:40%; height:40% height:fit-content'/> <div style='width:50%'> <h4 style=font-weight:600; font-size:25px; padding-bottom:15px'>#1 – Four</h4> <p>This album for sure had more bops that I think possibly anyone who listens to it can leave with one song being stuck in their head. Beautiful harmonies are heard in “Once in a Lifetime” and “Illusion” which I adore. There are only 2 songs I don’t like, so that about sums up how this ended up being my favourite album. Best songs to dance/groove to are “Act my Age”, “Girl Almighty”, and “No Control”. And here is where Niall sung, “we took a chonce”.</p> <p style='padding-top:20px'>Favourite: Fireproof❤️‍🔥</p> </div> </div>"

    "content":"<p style='padding-bottom:30px'>After One Direction came in 3rd in the X-Factor, Simon Cowell was willing enough to sponsor them to continue their careers as singers. They released their debut track “What Makes You Beautiful” (that has now reached over 1 Billion views) and it premiered at No.28 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles. After this, they went on to create their first debut album “Up All Night” and they became household names in the U.K, U.S, and beyond. The popular song became so impactful that they found themselves on the biggest of international stages when they performed “What Makes You Beautiful” at the closing ceremony o the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. They then released “Take Me Home”, “Midnight Memories”, “Four”, and “Made in the A.M”. After 5 years together, the band announced their “hiatus”(it’s been 7 years!!) and each one pursued their solo careers.</p><p>In 2016, Harry signed a solo contract with Columbia Records and released his self-titled debut album 11 months later to critical acclaim, and later embarked on a world tour (I was lucky enough to attend). Through this time however of his first release of his set-titled album, he was relatively not as big as Justin Bieber or Shawn Mendes, but only after his sophomore album, “Fine Line” came out in late 2019, his hit singles hit a different chord in the world.
